    Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.

    Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser.
    A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

    HTML is heavily used for creating pages that are displayed on the world wide web.
    Every page contains a set of HTML tags, including hyperlinks which are used
    for connecting to other pages.
    Every page that we witness on the world wide web is written using a version of HTML code.
    Document creation on the internet is dominated by HTML and its basic concept via tag and DOM, i.e. document object model. 
    HTML tags are inserted before and afterwards or phrases to locate their format and location on the page.
    A web document consists of three sections: title, head, and body.
